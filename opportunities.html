              Supervised machine learning (SML) has the potential to have a great impact in various fields and industries. Some opportunities of SML are as follows:

              According to Marzyeh Ghassemi et al., (2020) in their journal article, “A Review of Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning for Health'', supervised machine learning is greatly used to manage electronic health records (EHR). Modern electronic health records (EHR) provide data to answer clinically important questions. With the rapidly growing data in electronic health records, healthcare industries are turning to machine learning to take care of all the their data. Electronic health records are very important as health problems impact human lives. During medical care, health providers collect clinical data about each particular patient, and gather knowledge and data from the general population, to determine how to treat that specific patient. Therefore, data plays a incredibly important role in addressing health problems, and improved information is crucial to improving patient care. This is why supervised machine learning is playing a great part in improving modern electronic health records. Healthcare professionals are prone to human error while inputting data into the electronic health records whereas machine learning uses the knowledge and data gathered from the general population to make the electronic health records near perfect. This helps healthcare professionals improve patient care greatly.

              According to Vivienne Sze et al., (2017) in their journal article, “Hardware for machines learning: Challenges and opportunities”, supervised machine learning is also greatly used in robotic products. Robotic products like drones and self-driving cars heavily rely on supervised machine learning as their goal is to take immediate action based on the data provided which supervised machine learning can help out with a lot. In these sorts of products, supervised machine learning often involves transforming the input data into a higher dimensional space (increasing the movement on the x, y, and z coordinates), which, along with programmable weights, increases data movement making it easier for the robotic product to identify patterns which therefore helps it take immediate action if the pattern suddenly changes to an outlier.

              According to Vivienne Sze et al., (2017) in their journal article, “Hardware for machines learning: Challenges and opportunities”, supervised machine learning is also greatly used in digital devices. Digital devices such as surveillance cameras and wearable/portable electronics also heavily rely on supervised machine learning as their goal is to identify trends with the data provided and machine learning can also help a lot with that. In a lot of digital devices such as the ones stated above, local embedded processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or latency concerns, or limitations in the communication bandwidth. However, at the sensor there is additional accuracy requirements. Supervised machine learning helps sort out these addition accuracy requirement by outputting near perfect data samples.
