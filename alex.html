                <h3>
                    <p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly relevant in many aspects of
                        society such as e-commerce and medical fields, as well as transportation. This primarily due to
                        the labor ML alleviates so that resources can be redistributed elsewhere. However, given the
                        transparency of its thought process, ML raises ethical concerns (Watson et al. 2019).<br><br>
                        This is especially relevant to the healthcare field, as doctors must take many things into
                        factor before making an executive decision. Given its inability to explain the reason behind its
                        decision, ML could be a liability to doctors, as doctors are unable to interpret and justify the
                        machine’s reasoning and thought process to produce the result (Zihni et al. 2020).<br><br>

                        This also
                        raises the question of who would be liable if a patient becomes misdiagnosed, as both the
                        machine and human could be at fault. This argument would generally be taken to court however,
                        since it may have been the machine’s fault, the blame could also be shifted to the company that
                        implemented the ML system in the first place, which is why laws must be continuously iterated
                        until foolproof before ML is widely implemented- especially in health care. This concept of
                        morality is further explored by Huang (2019) in “Law’s Halo and The Moral Machine”, which
                        provides a prime example of the moral dilemma we may face in the near future.<br><br> 
                        
                        His example
                        consists of an autonomous vehicle that is certain to crash. It has two paths to take, which
                        either severely injure the passenger it is transporting or hits two cyclists while maneuvering.
                        He brings up the question of “how will we judge that decision”, as both choices can be
                        justified. If the vehicle were to hit the cyclists, it would be considered as protecting its
                        passengers, whereas if it were to crash into the ditch, it would be saving two people at the
                        risk of another. <br><br>

                        The fact that supervised machine learning revolves around the data that is used
                        to train it, means that external factors cannot typically be taken into account when coming to a
                        decision, which reinforces the idea of continuous iteration of the laws that surround ML prior
                        to wider applications in the world.</p>
