        <h3>
          <p>
            The usage of machine learning (ML) has been increasing overtime especially in recent years. This is because
            it has become very relevant in today’s society due to a lot of new technology coming out that heavily
            depends on machine learning to take care of data accuracy to reduce labour hours and therefore labour costs
            such as modern electronic health records, robotic projects (such as drones and self-driving cars), and
            digital devices (such as surveillance cameras and wearable/portable devices).<br><br>
            
            However, despite all of these
            advantages, machine learning has a lot of disadvantages. One major disadvantage of machine learning is the
            rise in ethical concerns for machine learning. One relevant ethical concern in our current society is the
            concern for the use of machine learning in the military.<br><br> 
            
            Considering the facts that the military uses
            special drones that use machine learning to navigate and detect specific people, these drones are loaded
            with ammo and are sent into battlefields instead of foot soldiers (this is so that soldiers do not need to
            endanger their lives when a machine can just do it for them), and the fact that they could possibly be
            hacked into and innocent people in other countries could die raises a very big ethical concern.<br><br> 
            
            Another
            relevant ethical concern in our current society is the fact that machine learning is being used in the
            medical field to deliver accurate and reliable data for medical professionals so they can treat their
            patients with the utmost care. But this raises the ethical concern of what would happen if the machine
            learning process failed. What if the medical professionals could not understand the reasoning behind the
            machine learning’s data. This would put the patients at risk and could even lead to death if the
            prescriptions are wrong. This could have a very negative effect on the patients’ families.<br><br> 
            
            Another question
            that arise from this situation is who would take the blame, the medical professional or the machine. These
            are all very important factors to consider before using machine learning. Machine learning has a lot of
            advantages but one little slip up could have deadly consequences.
