          <h3 style="font-size:1.25vw;"><p>Machine learning (ML) is the study and creation of algorithms that are trained and automatically improved. There are two types of machine learning (ML): supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. They both strive for the same goal but use different ways of doing so. Supervised machine learning is when humans feed the machine a load of data which then the machine uses to learn about the real world and therefore improve to serve humans better. In contrast, unsupervised machine learning is when the machine leans on its own from real world experiences it faces on a regular basis without the need of human interference. It uses the data it finds in the real world to improve itself and to serve humans better, the same goal supervised machine learning is striving for. For our research, we will be focused on just supervised machine learning. Supervised machine learning is used in the real world to make accurate decisions and predictions without the explicit programming to do so. This helps to further improve technology that is being used in the real world, by various fields all the way from the big tech companies to small start ups and even in the medical fields. Supervised machine learning has a lot of advantages. Some advantages of supervised machine learning are that it helps automatize workplaces (such as medical fields) to reduce human error and increase efficiency, it helps with object and face detection for projects such as autonomous driving (self-driving cars) and the justice systems, and it further helps with space and deep sea exploration.<br><br>
            But just like with every other type of technology, supervised machine learning has quite a bit of disadvantages as well such as the breaching of privacy, challenges of ethical and moral concerns (this can originate from feeding the machine biases or misleading data which could alter the output), and the inability to learn on its own (unlike unsupervised machine learning) which means the machine still requires human input. Supervised machine learning has a lot of potential to make a great difference in the world but it is also good practice to be well informed about the disadvantages of supervised machine learning as those can bring negative differences into the world.</p>
