        <div class="box">
          <h3 style="font-size:1.25vw;"><p>Machine learning, if not implemented correctly, could pose a large risk to those who attempt to use it. This is mainly due to the fact that using ML systems requires a large amount of funding to both apply the technology to a project, as well as maintain it. The cost alone, justifies the reason for thorough planning when developing an ML system, as everything must be accounted for. Any error regardless of the size could lead to negative effects for not only the company but also the clientele.<br>
          According to a blog post written by SEI(Software Engineering Institute), which conducts research for the U.S government, the fact that using an ML system requires large quantities of data that must be sorted and labeled, skills such as software engineering and statistics are well sought after, which increases the gross costs for projects (Cohen, 2020, May 18). If there were an unaccounted factor that caused the project to fail, depending on the severity of the situation, the company could be at a complete loss and perhaps even go bankrupt.
          </p>
          <p>Although so much time is dedicated to the development and planning phase of an ML system, there are some things that are not accounted for, which could lead to fatal risks in the long run after the ML system has been implemented. An example of a risk post-implementation is algorithmic bias, which is where the machine makes biased predictions on subjects it is testing against (Sun, et al., 2018). This problem is generally caused by insufficient training data and hinders the results, meaning that the information extracted from the machine could be unreliable, causing the company to lose money, as they have to spend more time training the algorithm so that it is no longer biased.</p>
          <p>This is mainly due to the costs required to apply the technology, as well as maintaining it. Any errors that occur while developing ML systems could cost companies a fortune, especially if the system is large in scale. This is also one of the main reasons why a sizable portion of developing a project that utilizes ML takes an extreme amount of time- as the project must be within a specific budget, timeframe and meet the client’s needs.<br> 
          According to [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09638237.2018.1521946?casa_token=by_alFs9MtwAAAAA%3AB8d-KYp0Ev9cRkEKtv5uLmUKOttgKfqii1ygdMNrRLFrJB7ghZ-tBYN9GzeY9HpeeP2N9KOe_RtJ], “sensitivity was low, indicating a potential for false negative diagnoses.”. The effects of this could be devastating and introduces the idea that if machine learning is not implemented correctly, repercussions could become more common, and the effects of it could be devastating.
